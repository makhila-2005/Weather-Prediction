📋 Overview
This project aims to predict weather conditions using historical weather data and machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

🔍 Objectives
Load and analyze historical weather data.

Clean and preprocess the dataset.

Build machine learning models to predict specific weather features (e.g., temperature, humidity, rainfall).

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

Deploy or test the model for real-time predictions (optional).

🧰 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Jupyter Notebook (for development)
